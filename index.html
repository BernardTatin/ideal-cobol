<p>One of my first job in the 80's was to write some code in Cobol. It was about factory management, I don't remember more. After that job, I didn't touch Cobol anymore. More than thirty years after that great story, it's really strange to code again in Cobol. I was really surprised to remember some basic rules of the language. </p>

<p>Here is a time travel, more for my memories than for the others. Nevertheless, if you find something good for you, take it!

<p>All my code is written for Gnu Cobol 2.0. It works well on FreeBSD and Linux. I compile all with Makefiles written for GNU Make. In a later release, I will add Makefiles for BSD Make.</p>
