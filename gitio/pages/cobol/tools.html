				<h2>The editor</h2>

				<p>The main tools are the compiler and the editor. Under Linux, Vim, Komodo Edit and Sublime Text have a good Cobol mode. Atom has no syntax highlight but Bracketts Has one.</p>
				<p>I think all these editors work on Windows.</p>

				<h2>The compiler</h2>

				<p>I tried a lot of solutions on a Debian 64 bits and on FreeBSD 64 bits. The best compiler is <em>Open Cobol</em> (or <em>GNU Cobol</em>). We have some problems with it. The last version (2.0) is old and seems dead in a beta state. Compatibility with most known standards is not very good, but it's a choice of the authors.</p>
