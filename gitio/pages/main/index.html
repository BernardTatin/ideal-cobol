				<h2>80's are not dead, but I don't like disco...</h2>

				<p>One of my first job in the 80's was to write some code in Cobol. It was about factory management, I don't remember more. After that job, I didn't touch Cobol anymore. More than thirty years after that great story, it's really strange to code again in Cobol. I was really surprised to remember some basic rules of the language. </p>

				<p>Here is a time travel, more for my memories than for the others. Nevertheless, if you find something good for you, take it!</p>

				<h2>Cobol and Unix</h2>

				<p>All my code is written for <em>Gnu Cobol <strong>2.0</strong></em>. It works well on FreeBSD and Linux. I compile all with Makefiles written for GNU Make. In a later release, I will add Makefiles for BSD Make.</p>

				<h2>Why that's site ?</h2>

				<p>The first aim, is learning again Cobol. It will be done in several main steps:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>basics with text files,</li>
					<li>indexed files,</li>
					<li>databases connexions.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Before programming...</h2>
				<p>I've already done some experimentations. One of the conclusion is how to use <em>Makefiles</em>. All project <em>Makefiles</em> will set up some variables (application name, libraries...) and include a common one which contains all the logic for building and running applications. This common logic is in <code>mk/common.mk</code>.
				</p>

				<h2>For the C programmer</h2>
				<p>You'll find some <a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> such a <code>PICTURE 9</code> doesn't contain a byte value from 0 to 255 but a single decimal digit from 0 to 9.</p>
