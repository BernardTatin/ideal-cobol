		<h2>Ye who wrote C all your life...</h2>

		<h4>Awful PIC 9</h4>
		<p>A <code>PICTURE 9</code> doesn't contain a byte value from 0 to 255 but a single decimal digit from 0 to 9. The compiler (<em>OpenCobol 2.0</em>) tells you <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>
		<p>Never forget it!</p>

		<h4>String manipulations</h4>
		<p>The functions <code>STRING</code> and <code>UNSTRING</code> are the only which travel time and versions without too much modifications. Some intrinsic functions can also help.</p>
		<p></p>

		<h4>Intrinsic functions</h4>
		<p>We can compare them to <em>C</em> or <em>Lisp</em> <em>inline</em> functions. We find a lot of them through several Cobol compilers with few modifications. We can use them without too much fear.</p>
		<p></p>

		<h4>Line endings</h4>
		<p>Each lines ends with a dot (<code>.</code>). That's true. And the question is <em>what's a line of code</em>?</p>
